Instructions for proTodos

You must complete the following features: dialog boxes and context menus which allow the user to delete, edit and add a new reminder.

Search on stackoverflow for creating a custom dialog box in Android. You will need to design your dialog box with a layout and inflate the layout like with any activity.  You should be able to re-use your dialog box code for both "New Reminder" and "Edit Reminder". Pass in the title and the color to the constructor of your dialog box (green for "New Reminder" and blue for "Edit Reminder"). 

Place an icon of your choosing in the Action Bar. When the user clicks it, it should launch the "New Reminder" dialog.
